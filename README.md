Democracy Chain: A Blockchain-Based Voting System
This repository contains the code and documentation for Democracy Chain, a secure and transparent voting system built on the Aptos blockchain.


Problem:
Traditional voting methods are vulnerable to fraud, lack transparency, and can present participation barriers.


Solution:
Democracy Chain leverages the power of blockchain technology to create a trustworthy and accessible electoral framework. 

Our system utilizes Aptos smart contracts to ensure:


Enhanced Security: Only eligible voters can cast their votes, preventing fraud and manipulation.


Transparency: Every vote is recorded on the blockchain, allowing for real-time tracking and verification.


Accessibility: The user-friendly digital platform facilitates participation from a diverse range of voters.


Auditability: The immutable nature of blockchain enables comprehensive audits of the voting process.


Key Technologies:
Aptos Smart Contracts: Securely execute voting processes and ensure voter eligibility.
Well Done Wallet: Provides a user-friendly interface for voters to interact with the system.
Move Programming Language: Used to develop the smart contracts for the voting system.
Aptos Blockchain: Provides the decentralized and tamper-proof infrastructure for the voting platform.
